It took nearly 4 hours for me to Dual-Boot Ubuntu 20.04.
I started to write the blog describing my journey on the next day itself and made sure that I had saved my progress..
But Unfortunately,all my progess of the blog have been lost..All I have as a proof of my attempt to write a blog is the 
number of tags which I had used previously...I have a attched a screenshot of that..Sorry..
