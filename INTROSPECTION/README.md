WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ME?
The main intention to join Amfoss is to improve my coding skills across different Programming Languages
and to decode tougher programmes eventually building me into a pro-programmer..I really love Programming and 
always wantedv to include my thought-process and all the logic I have to develop a particular code..and I felt and 
I am pretty sure that Amfoss is the perfect place to land at to enhance our coding skills and bring out the best in us.
I am a fnatic gamer so hope that Amfoss will be a perfect platform for developing own games and excel in that realm too..

What I would be doing for next 6 months?
As the academic loads a increasing each and every second,I have the responsibility to manage my time efficiently among all my activities..
I am bound to partition my time among the Academics+Club tasks+My artistic skills(Music and Veena playing) and last but not the least for my 
Games and recreations...I am tooo much interested in exploring much into the tech-world..So hoping for a nice journey at Amrita along with
amFOSS..

My contribution
It's a promise from my side to work as hard as I can to complete all the assignents which I get from amFOSS and even help others with the doubts n 
difficulties tooo...

Opinion on selection process
Simply the best!!!There are many instances where the selection process is very easy so that many people join and think it as a way to gain popularity..
but on the contrary,here at amFOSS the selection process was indeed challenging to select the best among the bests...Indeed Only the fittest can survive here..
